# html

This repo is for practices purposes and actually my first commit to github.

It was exciting knowing that I was able to finally commit a content.

I am however, looking forward to sharing some of my practice code here.

Can not wait to have others contributing to my repo.

Feel free sharing suggestion to help refine the purity of the code I write.

 However, I am also opened for collaborations and joint projects.
 
 (What this repo contains:)
 
 basic html and css code

 hands on new technologies 
 
 both web technologies as well as practical engineering technologies

thanks
